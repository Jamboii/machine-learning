# Machine Learning
Source code for various small machine/deep learning projects written in Python.

Each project can be ran using Jupyter Notebook.

## Projects

- [Perceptron Implementation](/Perceptron): A basic implementation of the perceptron using 20 training and 1000 test points. Accuracy compared using Perceptron Criterion, Hinge Loss, and Mean-Squared Error (MSE).

- [XOR Case Implementation](/XOR%20Case): An implementation of the XOR case using predefined, manually computed weights for a 2 layer network with 2 neurons in the hidden layer using ReLU activation for both layers.

- [Ionosphere Autoencoder](/Ionosphere%20Autoencoder): A basic autoencoder meant to demonstrate the effects of L2-regularization and the addition of Gaussian noise to the inputs. Uses the Ionosphere dataset (351 instances, 34 attributes, binary class labels). Written using Keras.
